There were moments I wanted to quit, especially around mile 14, but pushing through that wall is what makes the difference on race day. I‚Äôm tracking nutrition, sleep, and mental health just as closely as pace and mileage now. Excited for what‚Äôs ahead!",

These past two weeks helped me reset both physically and mentally. Now it‚Äôs all about refining my turns and working on my underwater dolphin kicks. Let‚Äôs make this season unforgettable!",

Months of hard work finally paying off. üåü\n\nBeam has always been my most challenging apparatus ‚Äî the precision and focus it demands are unreal. I've been practicing this move for nearly six months, and finally hitting it clean in training brought me to tears. Shoutout to my coaches and teammates for never letting me give up. Next step: competition-ready!",

The energy from the crowd kept me going even when I was gassed in the 4th quarter. All those early morning workouts and late-night film sessions are starting to show.
